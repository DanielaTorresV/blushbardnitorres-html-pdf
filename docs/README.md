## Configuration

### Step 1 -  Basic setup

Access in github to VTEX APPS and search react-app-template (https://github.com/vtex-apps/react-app-template) this is the template base for this project. If you want 
to start the project from the beginning clone this template.

If you want to work with this template open your terminal a clone this repository, command (git clone [urlRepository], to your local files to be able to effectively 
start working on it.
Then, access the repository's directory using your terminal. 

### Step 3 - Editing the `Manifest.json`

Once in the repository directory, it is time to edit the `manifest.json` file. 

Once you are in the file, you must replace the `vendor` value. `vendor` is the account name you are working on, if you want yo can modify name, titel, and description. For example:

```json
{
  "vendor": "storecomponents",
  "name": "my-custom-component",
}
```
You should also check the `package.json` file globar and the file in react folder, verify the name and the version.

In your terminal enter in react folder, command (cd react), then put yarn in the terminal, this commad install node-modules folder, close your editor and open again 
the project in your editor, you should have install and funtional the modules in react folder.

### Step 5- Run and preview your component

Then time has come to upload all the changes you made in your local files to the platform. For that, use the `vtex link` command. If the process runs without any  
errors, the following message will be displayed: `App linked successfully`.

To use the component in a store you should this in your "dependencies" in `manifest.json` file, "vendorName.componentName" : "version", for example:
 ```json
{
"dependencies": {
   "itgloberspartnercl.pdf-reader": "0.x"
  }
}
```
Then put the component where ever you need.
